# Graduation_Project_DRL_Optimal_Precoder_MU_MISO
This project employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to design optimal precoder vectors and allocate power in MU-MISO systems. It includes implementations for single-user and multi-user scenarios, integrating SNR as an input, and demonstrates improved performance over traditional precoder methods.
